# Simple-11-bit-R-Type-Processor-Design-Implementation
This repository contains the design and simulation of a custom 11-bit R-type Processor built from scratch using Logisim. The project focuses on understanding the internal architecture of a CPU, including instruction decoding, register management, and ALU operations.
